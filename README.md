# Cypress Kitchen Sink with BDD

## Overview
This release 0.0.1 of a project that adds a BDD (Cucumber) layer on top of the Cypress Kitchen Sink examples project. This project was developed on and off over a number of months, during which time I gained more experience with Cypress so some of the early code I wrote isn't great and needs to be reworked so that the project has a consistent style throughout, hence this being release 0.0.1. I plan to keep chipping away at refactoring this project and once I am happy with the overall style will create a 1.0.0 release.

Why did I create this project? It was partly an exercise in Cypress & BDD - I'm a bit of a Cucumber evangelist and wanted to show I could layer BDD on top of almost anything, including a whole bunch of tests that weren't really designed for it. It was also partly a way of getting more familiar with some aspects of Cypress I hadn't really used before.

The rest of this README will be fleshed out as I rework the project code.
